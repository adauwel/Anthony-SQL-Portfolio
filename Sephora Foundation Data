Here is a table I created with Sephora's best selling foundations with the name, brand, brand, price, rating, and number of reviews. I used this to answer some questions.

CREATE TABLE foundations (
  foundation_name VARCHAR(100),
  brand VARCHAR(50),
  price DECIMAL(8, 2),
  rating DECIMAL(3, 1),
  num_reviews INT
);
INSERT INTO foundations (foundation_name, brand, price, rating, num_reviews)
VALUES 
  ('Dior Backstage Face & Body Foundation', 'Dior', 40.0, 4.7, 1023),
  ('Estée Lauder Double Wear Stay-in-Place Foundation', 'Estée Lauder', 42.0, 4.8, 1567),
  ('Fenty Beauty Pro Filt''r Soft Matte Longwear Foundation', 'Fenty Beauty', 35.0, 4.5, 2389),
  ('Make Up For Ever Ultra HD Invisible Cover Foundation', 'Make Up For Ever', 43.0, 4.6, 893),
  ('Giorgio Armani Luminous Silk Foundation', 'Giorgio Armani', 64.0, 4.9, 745),
  ('Tarte Amazonian Clay 12-Hour Full Coverage Foundation', 'Tarte', 39.0, 4.7, 1121),
  ('Too Faced Born This Way Foundation', 'Too Faced', 39.0, 4.6, 1743),
  ('NARS Natural Radiant Longwear Foundation', 'NARS', 49.0, 4.8, 932),
  ('Hourglass Vanish Seamless Finish Foundation Stick', 'Hourglass', 46.0, 4.6, 521),
  ('Urban Decay All Nighter Liquid Foundation', 'Urban Decay', 40.0, 4.5, 1087);
  
  --What is the average rating of the foundations at Sephora?--
  
  SELECT AVG(rating) AS average_rating
  FROM foundations;
  
  --How many foundations have a price higher than $40?--
  
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS foundation_count
  FROM founadtions
  WHERE price > 40;
  
  --What are the top 3 most expensive foundations>--
  
  SELECT foundation_name, brnad, price
  FROM foundations
  ORDER BY price DESC LIMIT 3;
  
  --What is the average rating of foundations priced higher than $50 and have more than 1000 reviews?--
  
  SELECT AVG(rating) AS average_rating
  FROM foundations
  WHERE price > 50.0 AND num_reviews > 1000;
  
  --How many foundations have a rating higher than the lowest rating among foundations priced between $40 and $60?--
  
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS foundation_count
  FROM foundations
  WHERE rating > (
    SELECT MIN(rating)
    FROM foundations
    WHERE price >= 40.0 AND price <= 60.0;
    
  -- Which brand has the largest price range between its lowest-priced and highest-priced foundation? --
  
  SELECT brand, MAX(price) - MIN(price) AS price_range
  FROM foundations
  GROUP BY brand
  ORDER BY price_range DESC
  LIMIT 1;
